## Answer questions

Q1: Which five cities located in Kanawha County, West Virginia got the most loans (in number of loans)? How many did each get? To answer this question, you'll have to clean the very messy "city" field.

Note: To answer this question, please fully clean the city field for Kanawha County cities. Hint: once cleaned, the dataframe that counts the number of loans by city should have 38 distinct cities for Kanawha County.

A1:
```{r}

# Write your code in this codeblock.

glimpse(wv_ppp_loans)

kanawha_loans <- wv_ppp_loans %>%
  filter(project_county_name == "KANAWHA")  %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

#clean to lowercase because losers

wv_ppp_loans %>%
  filter(project_county_name == "KANAWHA")  %>%
  mutate(city = str_to_title(city)) %>%
    mutate(city = case_when(
      city == "S Charleston" ~ "South Charleston",
      city == "So Charleston" ~ "South Charleston",
      city == "Crosslanes" ~ "Cross Lanes",
      city == "Balle" ~ "Belle",
      city == "Elkveiw" ~ "Elkview",
      city == "Charelston" ~ "Charleston",
      str_detect(city,"^St") ~ "Saint Albans",
  TRUE ~ city)) %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(
    kanawha_loans=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(kanawha_loans))
  

```

Q2: What is the name of the business that got the largest loan (by dollar value) in the 5-digit ZIP code in West Virginia that had the highest dollar amount in total loans (by dollar value)? Write up a short paragraph that also answers these questions:

* Where in West Virginia is this ZIP code located?
* How much was the business' loan for?
* How much of that loan was forgiven?
* Which number is bigger, the loan amount or the forgiveness amount? Can you explain the discrepancy?

This ZIP code is located in Kanawha County. The forgiveness amount is larger than what was given, because of the program offers loans at a 1 percent interest rate, so the interest was also refunded. 

A2: 

```{r}
# Hint
# First, create a dataframe that shows the top 5-digit ZIP code by total dollar amount
# Second, use the top ZIP code to create a separate dataframe that shows the business with the biggest loan in that ZIP code.

glimpse(wv_ppp_loans)

top_five_zip <- wv_ppp_loans %>%
  mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
  group_by(zip) %>%
  summarise(
    amount_per_zip=sum(amount)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(amount_per_zip))

# top zip is 25301

wv_ppp_loans %>%
  mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
  filter(zip == "25301") %>%
  arrange(desc(amount))

#business is the eye and ear clinic
  

```

Q3: Five business entities owned by the spouse of a member of West Virginia's U.S. House delegation got PPP loans. Write up a paragraph that answers the following questions.   

  * What are the businesses' names?
  * What do the businesses do?
  * How much money did the five businesses receive in total?
  * What percentage of the total loan amount have been forgiven?
  * How did the U.S. House member vote on the legislation initially authorizing the PPP loan program.

Feel free to add any interesting "color" (little interesting details) you find in your research.  

Some hints to help you answer this question:

* West Virginia's three U.S. House members are listed [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/WV#representatives)
* To find businesses they or their families own, you can search for financial disclosure forms for U.S. House members [here](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure#Search).
  * To speed things up, here are direct links to the three U.S. House members most recent financial disclosures, which I found by searching the site linked above.
  * [Rep. 1](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10042042.pdf)
  * [Rep. 2](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10040330.pdf)
  * [Rep. 3](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2020/10042734.pdf)
* When you examine the disclosure forms, there may be lots of stock sales and retirement accounts mixed in.  Ignore those. In the table in the disclosure forms, look for "Partnership" or "C-Corp" in the column named "Income Type"
* This is a link to details on passage of the [CARES ACT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748). You can find a link to how the House voted by clicking on a link from [this page](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/actions).

A3:
The businesses are DM Motor, Dutch Miller of Charleston, Dutch Miller of Charlotte, Dutch Miller Subaru, and Dutch Miller Chevrolet. Clearly, they are all auto dealerships. In total, all 5 companies received $3,105,300	in loans, of which 101.1326 percent was forgiven because of interest. Carol Miller, the representative in Congress and the wife of the owner of these businesses voted yes on the CARES Act.  

```{r}

# Hint
# First, create a dataframe that only has loans to those five companies
# Second, use that newly created dataframe to calculate total loan amount and percentage forgiven for those companies

#this creates the 5 companies
miller_loans <- wv_ppp_loans %>% 
    filter(str_detect(name, "DUTCH MILLER|DM MOTOR")) %>% 
    summarise(name, amount, forgiveness_amount)


#now do the other (this gives each individual loan)
miller_loans %>%
mutate(percent_forgive = forgiveness_amount/amount * 100)  %>%
summarise(forgiveness_amount, name, amount) %>%
  group_by(name)


#this should create the total percentage although not in the way I anticipated
#not efficient but gives me aggregates I guess. 
miller_loans %>%
      mutate(total_amount = sum(amount),
      total_forgive = sum(forgiveness_amount),
      percent_total = total_forgive/total_amount * 100) %>%
    group_by(amount)


```
