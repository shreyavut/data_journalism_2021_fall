## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, [Over a Dozen Black and Latino Men Accused a Cop of Humiliating, Invasive Strip Searches. The NYPD Kept Promoting Him.](https://www.propublica.org/article/over-a-dozen-black-and-latino-men-accused-a-cop-of-humiliating-invasive-strip-searches-the-nypd-kept-promoting-him)

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 

allegations <- read_csv("data/CCRB-Complaint-Data_202007271729/allegations_202007271729.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    clean_disposition = case_when(
    str_detect(board_disposition, "^S") ~ "Substantiated",
    TRUE ~ board_disposition
  )
  ) %>% 
  #new column that identifies officers that are currently a higher rank than captain
  mutate(
    rank_above_captain = if_else(
      rank_now == 'Deputy Inspector' | 
      rank_now == 'Inspector' | 
      rank_now == 'Deputy Chief' | 
      rank_now == 'Assistant Chief' | 
      rank_now == 'Bureau Chief' | 
      rank_now == 'Police Comissioner' | 
      rank_now == 'Chiefs and other ranks', "Yes", "No")
  )

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: [ “A dozen of those high-ranking officers have three or more complaints with substantiated allegations; 10 are white. Five have reached the rank of deputy inspector, the lowest promoted at the commissioner’s discretion; all are white.”]
* **Analysis summary**: [We used code to filter out the specific data woven throughout this sentence("substantiated allegations", "10 are white", "rank of deputy inspector"), which allowed us to narrow down and determine how the data was organized for analysis in this article. We initially narrowed our code by filtering by ethnicity which returned 69 rows of information. We then determined that we needed to further narrow the data by 'rank_now' and 'board_disposition'. We learned that our data has been updated by ProPublica, leading to a slight skew in our numbers versus those in the article (25 total (3 allegations, 17 who were white, 1 Hispanic officer who held the title of Deputy Inspector).]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here


#glimpsing to find rows
glimpse(allegations)


# filtering !
## text says ranks above captain, so not including those. 

## below is high-ranking officers with complaints:
highrankallegations <- allegations %>%
filter(rank_above_captain == "Yes") %>%
filter(clean_disposition == "Substantiated") %>%
  group_by(unique_mos_id, first_name, last_name, rank_now, mos_ethnicity) %>% ## this part is where it tells you how many each officer got (looking for 3 or more complaints!)  
  summarize(
    count = n())  %>%
    arrange(desc(count)) %>%
    filter(count > 2)

highrankallegations

#according to above, 25 officers had 3 or more complaints

## filter by race (# of white officers)
highrankallegations %>% 
  filter(mos_ethnicity == "White")

#above shows 17 white officers. 

## those that reached deputy inspector 
highrankallegations %>% 
  filter(rank_now == "Deputy Inspector")


# Display results of code below this codeblock 

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: [“Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.”]
* **Analysis summary**: [ In this section of code, we began by looking into the allegations by rank, filtering by the ranks of "Captain", "Deputy Inspector","Inspector", Deputy Chief", Assistant Chief", "Bureau Chief", "Police Commissioner" and "Chiefs and other ranks". Finally, we filtered the data by substantiated allegations. This allowed us to reach the conclusion that eighty-six of around 420 officers in the department who hold a rank above captain have had at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB.]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

#what are the ranks
glimpse(allegations$rank_now)


# finding the sustained allegations 
allegations %>%
filter(rank_above_captain == "Yes") %>%
filter(clean_disposition == "Substantiated") %>%
  group_by(unique_mos_id, first_name, last_name, rank_now, mos_ethnicity) %>%
  summarize(
    total_allegations = n()
  ) 
#most common misconduct allegation
allegations %>%
  filter(rank_above_captain == "Yes") %>%
  filter(clean_disposition == "Substantiated") %>%
  group_by(allegation) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

#finding the specific incident (what occurred)

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 3

* **Sentence text**: ["Of at least 77 allegations made against him in 26 separate CCRB complaints, 29 were unsubstantiated; five were “unfounded,” meaning investigators concluded the incident never took place; and 27 were “exonerated,” meaning the conduct fell within patrol guidelines."]
* **Analysis summary**: [In order to uncover the data used for this sentence of the article, we created the oject 'cchrisallegations' and filtered by last name 'Mccormack' and first name 'Christophe'. We grouped the data for Christopher McCormack by 'unique_mos_id', 'first_name', 'last_name' and 'allegation' and this returned 26 separate allegations. After this, we further grouped the data by 'clean_disposition' and were able to organize the allegations made against McCormack by unsubstantiated allegations, unfounded allegations and exonerated allegations.]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
chrisallegations <- allegations %>% 
  filter(last_name == "Mccormack",
         first_name == "Christophe") %>% 
   group_by(unique_mos_id, first_name, last_name, allegation) %>% 
    summarize(
    count = n())  %>%
    arrange(desc(count))

chrisallegations
## shows 26 separate allegations 
## unfounded claims were not entered into the dataset 


## below codeblock shows the 
allegations %>% 
  filter(last_name == "Mccormack",
         first_name == "Christophe") %>% 
  group_by(clean_disposition) %>% 
   summarize(
    count = n())  %>%
    arrange(desc(count)) 
  


# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Sentence text**: [But many of the officers also said that it’s possible to be an effective cop without so many complaints. An overwhelming majority of the city’s 36,000 officers do not have a single substantiated complaint on their records; only 1 in 9 does.]
* **Analysis summary**: [For this sentence, we began by creating an entirely new data set that would return the total number of officers with at least one substantiated complaint. We created an object called 'officers_with_complaints' and filtered by 'substantiated' allegations and used distinct to return only the 'unique_mos_id', 'first_name', 'last_name' and 'rank_now' columns. After this, we divided the number of officers with at least one substantiated complaint by the total number of officers, in order to conclude that a majority of the city's 36,000 officers do not have a substantiated complaint on their record, only 1 in 9 does.]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

#make new dataset that gives number of officers with at least one substantiated complaints
officers_with_complaints <- allegations %>%
  filter(clean_disposition == "Substantiated") %>%
  distinct(unique_mos_id, first_name, last_name, rank_now)
#number of officers with at least one substantiated complaint/total number of officers
officers_with_complaints %>%
    summarize(
      total = n()/36000
    ) 
#1 in 9 = .1111

# Display results of code below this codeblock

officers_with_complaints 

```

### Sentence 5

* **Sentence text**: [Use data analysis to justify that decision. Why does he stand out as newsworthy, from all of the people they could have selected? Why, do you think, did the reporters single him out for an in-depth story. Write code to support your argument.]
* **Analysis summary**: [ In our last section, we created code to show why Christopher McCormack stands out as newsworthy. The reporters singled him out as newsworthy because, although he had similar allegations to many other officers, his accusations by Black and Latino men of invasive, humiliating searches were far more significant. Reporters wrote that he was accused of pulling own their pants in public, exposing their genitals and using inappropriate methods to search for drugs. In our code, we began by filtering the cleaned allegations by "rank_above_captain= "Yes" and grouping by 'unique_mos_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'rank_now', and 'mos_ethnicity'. This returned results that showed the depth of the claims made against McCormack.]
